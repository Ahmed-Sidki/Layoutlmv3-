I demonstrate in this mini project the approach I use to solve a data science problem, specifically in the context of deep learning. The task is to detect the total amount (TTC) on a receipt document.

First, I conducted research on LayoutLMv3, to understand how the model works, I read its scientific paper, and then I moved on to the coding phase.

Paper : https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.08387.                                                                                                                 
For the  code, it's the hugginface documentation ðŸ¤—
