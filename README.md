I demonstrate in this mini project the approach I use to solve a data science problem, specifically in the context of deep learning. The task is to detect the total amount (TTC) on a receipt document.
First, I conducted research to find the most suitable model for our use case. However, since the test requires the use of LayoutLMv3, I will proceed with that model. To understand how the model works, I read its scientific paper, and then I moved on to the coding phase.

For the  code, it's the hugginface documentation ðŸ¤—
